Components of Design

Antenna: Ferrite rod antenna

RF Amplifier: A wide-band low-noise amplifier (LM386)

Mixer: An active mixer IC (NE602)

Local Oscillator: crystal oscillator

IF Amplifier: IF amplifier module tuned for 455 kHz (SA612)

Detector: Diode (1N4148)

AF Amplifier: An amplifier for sound reinforcement (TDA2003)

Speaker: An 8 ohm, 1W speaker

The designed receiver successfully operated within the specified frequency band of 600 kHz to 1500 
kHz. This demonstrates that the RF amplifier and local oscillator were appropriately tuned to support 
the required range. The intermediate frequency (IF) stage consistently produced a stable 455 kHz 
signal, validating the proper configuration of the mixer and local oscillator. The RF amplifier 
effectively increased the signal strength without introducing significant noise.
